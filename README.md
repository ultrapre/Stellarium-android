# Stellarium-android
A modded version of Stellarium-Mobile

Fork of [chengxinlun's Stellarium-Mobile](https://github.com/chengxinlun/Stellarium-android)

Mobile platform specific source code http://stelladata.noctua-software.com/stellarium-mobile/stellarium-mobile-1.29.tar.gz 
Assets from https://code.launchpad.net/stellarium/
Note that changes have been made to the source code and assets (mainly use uncompressed PC version assets instead of compressed ones)

## Prerequisites

* Qt-for-android (Known to work on qt-5.11 and 5.12)

Please note that for version ealier than 5.10, API for permission models for Android 6.0+ were not correctly implemented in Qt.
Notably, Qt did not provide any API for requesting ```read/write to external storage``` permission. This permission is essential
to the application.

## Building APK

Set up android SDK and NDK, and environment in QtCreator.
Open ```stellarium.pro``` in QtCreator.
Push the Build button.

If the building process runs into problems while compiling ```dummy.cpp```, simply copy the file to build directory and rename it ```moc_predefs.h```.
